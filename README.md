# Welcome and Thank You!

This project was created to show a different style of web design in my portfolio. My attempt with this project was to build a site with a more clean, modern feel to it, while maintaing a fun, open feel.
I believe I have achieved that in what I have put together so far, though there is still more work to be done.
The base of this site was built using Bootstrap.
This is just the beginning of the site so far. I still have a few items I would like to work on.

- Properly resize paragraphs and headers past 1920px.
- Add a lazy-loading gallery using Flickr api and javascript.
- Add more interactivity for users.
